segcvoro
========

An experimental clone of segmented voronoi code found at Takashi Ohyama's website, http://www.nirarebakun.com/

My intentions is to experiment with the code a bit and see if it can be re-packaged into an usable library.

It does not look too good, when the segments are exacly vertical the voronoi code fails. :/
